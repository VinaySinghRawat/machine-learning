Election result prediction 

we used 4 csv files 
1.ModiRelatedTweetsWithSentiment.csv 
2.RahulRelatedTweetsWithSentiment.csv 

3.tweetsModi.csv
4.tweetsRG.csv


first 2 files are unprocessed data and with 1000+records we used these two large files in model p1.py as it uses large datasets it will take time for preprocessing and training the model so i used anotertwo small datasets for faster in p2.py which uses 3 and 4 csv file
